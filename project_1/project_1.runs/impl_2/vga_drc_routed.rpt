LUTLP-1#1 Critical Warning
Combinatorial Loop Alert  
1 LUT cells form a combinatorial loop. This can create a race condition. Timing analysis may not be accurate. The preferred resolution is to modify the design to remove combinatorial logic loops. If the loop is known and understood, this DRC can be bypassed by acknowledging the condition and setting the following XDC constraint on any one of the nets in the loop: 'set_property ALLOW_COMBINATORIAL_LOOPS TRUE [get_nets <myHier/myNet>]'. One net in the loop is clock. Please evaluate your design. The cells in the loop are: coloana_reg[7,1]_i_2.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net clock is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin coloana_reg[7,1]_i_2/O, cell coloana_reg[7,1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT coloana_reg[7,1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 20 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
coloana_reg[0,0], coloana_reg[0,1], coloana_reg[0,2], coloana_reg[0,3],
coloana_reg[0,4], coloana_reg[0,5], coloana_reg[0,6], coloana_reg[1,4],
coloana_reg[1,5], coloana_reg[6,0], coloana_reg[6,1], coloana_reg[6,2],
coloana_reg[6,3], coloana_reg[6,4], coloana_reg[6,5]
 (the first 15 of 20 listed)
Related violations: <none>
